1. copy csv file from repo 940smiley/recoveredtreasurestx to a list titled "working set" 
2. organize them by multiple different categories to allow different sorting and display options
3. display photo, card/player name, card number, year, brand, set.
4. once a card has been confirmed/verified remove it from the "working set" list & add it to the list titled "good to go", going foreward if a card from "good to go" is confirmed/verified again it should then be flagged for possible duplicate and dont allow further action untill its confirmed this is a duplicate unless another unverified copy exists on record then it should default to the next card, if there is no duplicate on record but on hand there is a duplicate add the new duplicate to the list "duplicates without scans"
6. if a card has a duplicate once one copy is confirmed and verified in hand then the other copy should be added to the list "DUPLICATES that lack/NEED VERIFYING" until it is confirmed.
7. any card that is checked against this repository that doesnt exist in the list will be added to the list titled "new need to scan".
8. all cards with no photo link should be added to the list titled "need photo"
9. allow manual and automatic classifying/marking of cards as verified/confirmed, destroyed, new, duplicate with one copy on record, duplicate with no copy on record, duplicate with multiple copies on record duplicate with multiple copies not on record, sold/remove (automatic marking/classifying dependent on list card is assigned to/dependent on hierarchey above)
10. allow saving of updates as working on verifying log.
11. allow choosing of sport, category, year, card number, name, brand for filtering, these choices will populate boxes that the user can enter details into as he goes to find the card he needs to verify, when a card is filtered there should be buttons to click that correspond to above choice for caqrd status.
